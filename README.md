## Contributing
If you want to contribute to PCSA-Android, subscribe to our [systers-dev](http://systers.org/mailman/listinfo/systers-dev) mailing list and shoot an introductory email. Pick an open issue from the [issue list](https://github.com/systers/PCSA-Android/issues) claim it in the comments, fix the issue and send us a pull request. 
If you find an issue yourself you can report it, a community member will get back to you and approve the issue. Then you can fix it and submit a PR. Please go through our issue list first and make sure the issues you are reporting  do not replicate the issues already reported. If you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.

### Avoid doing the following mistakes
1. Fix a new issue and submit a PR without reporting and getting it approved at first.
2. Fix an issue assigned to somebody else and submit a PR before the assignee does. 
3. Report issues which are previously reported by others. (Please check the closed issues too before you report an issue). 
4. Suggest completely new developments in the issue list. (Please use the mailing list for this kind of suggestions. Use issue list to suggest bugs/features in the already implemented sections.)

### Best Practices
1. Please use meaningful commit messages in PRs.
2. Do not over commit (Use more than one commit for a small change).
3. Please use separate PRs for separate issues/tasks

## Troubleshooting/Issues

If there are any problems encountered when installing the IDE, you may want to check and make sure you have a JDK and JRE installed. If you experience trouble building or running the project, you may not have the necessary build tools, which you can download directly through the IDE. If the app does not run on the emulator, it may be that the emulator is too slow, and you should look into installing one from an outside source. 

If there are any other questions or concerns, please contact the Systers contributors.
